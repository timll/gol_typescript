# gol_typescript
Entry for the it talents competition.
## installation
Just drag and drop to your webserver or just use [this link](https://timll.github.io/gol_typescript/) if you want to try it out.
## usage
Software should be self explanatory, especially when the audience could be anyone like in the web.
## performance
On a 256^2 board using the random pattern generator built-in, firefox did around 10 steps/second, while chrome was 10 times faster. Don't know why.
